# MegaRand10K

I originally built this project just for fun when I noticed that my Mega Randomizer project was nearing 10,000 downloads on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mega-randomizer), so I made a program that would periodically check the number of downloads and send me an email when it reached 10,000.

Since then, I have adapted the program to send me an email whenever the downloads reach a certain threshold, such as every 100 downloads.

Another reason I made this project is that I have been learning to use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for testing web applications. To be fair, this application is really using it for more of scraping-type purpose, but it was a fun use case that I thought of while learning Playwright. It has also been a great project for refreshing my memory on using the [Bree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bree) library for scheduling tasks, and the [Notification Api](https://www.notificationapi.com) to send email notifications.
